Do you have a piece of code you would like to submit for review but you don’t know if it’s ready? Or maybe you don’t know how to get it ready? Or would you like to review some code but would like to talk about the process first? Then this workshop is for you! If you would like to submit code for review, we will work with you to get your code in shape for submission (make sure it’s on GitHub, go over what is needed for the submission, etc). If you would like to know more about what it means to become a reviewer, we will answer any questions you might have!
