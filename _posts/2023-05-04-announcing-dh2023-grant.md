DHTech is excited to announce that thanks to funding from ADHO we are able to offer a DH2023 Registration Grant! Any DHTech member is eligible to apply. After proof of registration we will reimburse you for your registration costs for the [DH2023 conference](https://dh2023.adho.org/). Since our budget is limited, the earlier you apply the better your chances are to be awarded this grant.

To apply please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/MQ2HD68dEtsLg6Ca7). You will need to provide some basic information and two short statements about why you apply for the grant and why the grant should be awarded to you.

May the 4th be with you!
