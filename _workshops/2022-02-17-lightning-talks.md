### Robert Casties - *Minimal Computing solution providing a DTS API for TEI texts*

**About**  
Robert Casties is a Researcher and RSE at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, working on the many digital projects of the institute.

**Topic**  
[Distributed Text Services (DTS)](https://distributed-text-services.github.io/specifications/) is a proposed standard API to access TEI documents and their parts in a structured way, somewhat similar to IIIF for images. Iâ€™d like to present [dtsflat-server](https://github.com/robcast/dtsflat-server) a very simple server that can serve a subset of a DTS API from a DTSflat file structure and [simple-tei2dtsflat](https://github.com/robcast/simple-tei2dtsflat) a tool to create DTSflat files from a simple TEI document.
