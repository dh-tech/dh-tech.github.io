excerpt: "The first DHTech Meetup as a SIG took place on 29th of
  September.  Members of the initial steering committee introduced themselves
  and shared some ongoing projects of the SIG. The attendees discussed the
  specific focus of DH software development in context to the wider RSE
  movement. "

The SIG activities that were discussed include the new mentorship program, which will offer a long term, low frequency partnership between members working on various DH topics; and a community code review initiative, which aims to improve the code quality of DH projects. 

Attendees introduced themselves and shared some of their ongoing work; people joined from Europe, Australia, and the US. Some common themes that emerged were problems of sustainability, the difficulty  of finding and funding qualified software developers on the one hand, and training students in DH on the other hand.

On the more policy oriented side, attendees discussed the need to clarifying the goals of DHTech in relation to other software- and DH- focused initiatives and organizations, including the RSE movement and the Software Sustainability Initiative. The attendees suggested some of the topics unique to the DHtech  community, including a strong focus on data source criticism due to data heterogeneity and therefore workflows of data curation, the ethical implications of working with specific sources, and the close interaction of DH RSEs with non-coding experts in their code development.
