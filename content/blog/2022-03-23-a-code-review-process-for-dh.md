The Code Review Working Group of DHTech is starting the alpha phase of implementing a code review process for the digital humanities. For the initial round of reviews, we are looking for people willing to submit code for review and people willing to review someone else’s code. If you are willing to participate, we will also ask you to complete a feedback questionnaire at the end to help us improve the process. 

If you would like to have your code reviewed, please fill out the [code review request form](https://forms.gle/DKmsBSNsUY35nr6x9). Your code should be available on GitHub. It should take less than an hour to review. For more information about the conditions your code should meet, please review our [review preparation instructions](https://github.com/DHCodeReview/DHCodeReview/wiki/Authors:-Preparing-a-Code-Review).

If you are interested in being a reviewer, please fill out the [reviewer application form](https://forms.gle/PepxF6U64AT2Y5TZA). We expect reviews to take no more than an hour to complete. 

If you have any questions, feel free to get in touch with us either by joining the #code-review-wg channel on DHTech or by emailing Julia Damerow (jdamerow@asu.edu).
