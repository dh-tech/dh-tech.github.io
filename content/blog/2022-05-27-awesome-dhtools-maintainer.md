We want to thank [Moritz Mähr](https://github.com/maehr) and [Diego Siqueira](https://github.com/diegosiqueir4) for agreeing to become the official maintainers of our [Awesome DHtools repository](https://dh-tech.github.io/awesome-digital-humanities/). For the last few months they have steadily improved and added to the list. We are grateful that the list is in such capable hands!

If you have anything that you think is missing from the list, we welcome new issues and pull requests.
