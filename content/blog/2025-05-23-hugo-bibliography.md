Hugo-Bibliography is a new hugo plug-in designed to make adding citations into hugo projects much easier. It works by being added as a theme to a hugo website and then generating bibliography pages or citations through the bibliography and cite shortcodes. These shortcodes are generated based on CSL-JSON data present in the project's data/bibliography.json file. In addition, these shortcodes have a few extra features to allow for filtering out entries from the resulting bibliography. 

Currently, hugo-bibliography is designed for compatibility with Zotero. The module comes with a fetch-zotero.sh script that can be configured in the hugo project to automatically fetch Zotero data during the website's build and to store that data as CSL JSON in data/bibliography.json. In addition to this, the bibliography shortcode adds COinS data to each bibliography entry, allowing Zotero Connector to recognize any bibliography entry generated by hugo-bibliography. 

Hugo-Bibliography is currently being used on the dh-tech website on the publications page. For more details, check out hugo-bibliography's [github repo](https://github.com/dh-tech/hugo-bibliography)
