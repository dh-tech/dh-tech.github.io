Welcome to the creative core of DHTech! The DHTech community thrives on collaboration, experimentation, and shared problem-solving. Our community projects showcase this spirit by bringing together developers, researchers, and digital humanists to create tools, libraries, and resources that benefit the wider field. These initiatives often grow out of hackathons, working groups, or individual contributions that are opened up for collective use and improvement. Our current community projects are:

## [Hugo-Bibliography](https://github.com/dh-tech/hugo-bibliography)
