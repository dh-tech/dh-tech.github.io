Are you the lone DH RSE wolf in your group? Do you think there must be others like you at your institution and would like to connect? Or are you working in a group of DH RSEs or have you successfully mastered creating a local DH RSE community? On Thu, Jan. 23, 2020 at 10am ET/4pm CET, we will be discussing how to build local DH RSE communities. What have others done to successfully connect with like-minded people? How to make your institution aware of your type of work and its importance to research? We invite anyone interested in that topic to join our discussion on [Zoom](https://zoom.us/j/755179791).
