The April DHTech meetup will take place on **April 21, 2022 at 9am ET/3pm CEST**. The topic of the meetup will be the various types of **documentation (technical, API, end user, etc)** that might be required when developing software. We plan to discuss different solutions and workflows to write, distribute, and maintain documentation. Have you mastered documenting all aspects of your code? Are you struggling to at least keep a minimum of documentation up to date? Are you somewhere in between? We want to hear and learn from you! All participants are invited to **share their documentation processes and experiences**. Please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/XowNEod5mzMpsQnB6) if you would like to briefly talk about how you or your team handles documentation, the lessons you’ve learnt, or your favorite documentation tool (no more than 2 minutes and one slide).

You can register for the meetup [here](https://asu.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZEsc-6qpzgoH93OXGXJExrwCtSdUks2EEuM).
