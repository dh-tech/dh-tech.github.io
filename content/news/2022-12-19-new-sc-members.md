There are two changes in the DHTech Steering Committee for next year. First, we want to thank Itay Zandbank for sharing his expertise and supporting the efforts of DHTech by being a member of the DHTech Steering Committee the past 1.5 years! He helped to establish DHTech as an ADHO SIG and to grow the community. 

Second, we have a new Steering Committee member! Cole Crawford graciously volunteered to serve on the Steering Committee for the next two years. He is a software engineer in the Arts and Humanities Research Computing group at Harvard, but like many of us, that means he wears many hats as he jumps between full stack web development, DevOps, data visualization, natural language processing, project management, and teaching workshops. 

If you followed our emails and website closely, you might notice that the promised elections for the Steering Committee did not happen. This is due to the fact that we had exactly three nominees for the three open Steering Committee positions.
