# DHTech October Meetup on Education and Training

Our next DHTech meetup will be on October 5 at 9am ET/3pm CET. We will talk about how DHTech can support training and education of research software engineering work in the Digital Humanities. Jose Hernandez will give an overview of our vision for a new DHTech working group that focuses on developing and sharing training and education resources. Many of us have developed tutorials, slides, or other materials to teach technical topics for DH developers and digital humanists in general. How can we make them more widely available? How can we give credit for this important work? If you are interested in shaping a new working group, if you have insights about training and education that you would like to share, or if you simply want to participate in the discussion, please join us on Zoom ([register here](https://asu.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZcudOuvpjwvGdELJY68c9e2JQdYiyRok3bZ)).
