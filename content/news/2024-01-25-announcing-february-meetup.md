# DHTech February Meetup on Agent-based Modeling

Our next DHTech meetup will be on February 15, 2024 at 9am ET/3pm CET. We will talk about agent-based modeling (ABM)! Are you using agent-based models for a project? Or are you interested in learning more about ABM? Do you have questions you would like to discuss like how to best design and calibrate a model? Come join us on Zoom! You can register [here](https://asu.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZElduuprjsvEtFkc0xgDwpm5CVREJaBQDNT).

We are looking for people who would like to **give a lightning talk about their ABM-based project**! Please get in touch with the DHTech Steering Committee if you would be willing to talk about your project or a specific framework for about 5 minutes by emailing [dhtech.community@gmail.com](mailto:dhtech.community@gmail.com) or by reaching out on Slack!
