This year in August, [DH2024](https://dh2024.adho.org/) will be held at George Mason University in Arlington, Virginia, USA. DHTech will hold a **mini-conference at DH2024 themed “DH Inside Out”**. Typical DH conference presentations are focussed on the research with a slight nod to the technical details; we want to flip that format and dive more deeply into the technical aspects of the work, while still keeping it in context of the research and domain specifics. To that end, we invite submissions of interest to the people who work on the technical aspects of DH projects. 

We are also looking for volunteers to review submissions. Please see the full call [on our website](/blog/2023/12/19/dh-inside-out-dh2024/) for instructions on how to submit presentation proposals and on how to sign up as a reviewer.
