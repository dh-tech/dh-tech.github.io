# DHTech April Meetup on LLMs

Our next DHTech meetup will be on **April 18 at 9am ET/3pm CET**. We will be talking about **how large language models (LLM) affect the different aspects of research software engineering**. What does their existence mean for teaching software engineering especially in the DH context? How does the way we develop code for research change? How do LLMs change the role of the research software engineer or does it not impact it at all? If you want to give a **lightning talk** about your perspective please get in touch with us via Slack or by email ([dhtech.community@gmail.com](mailto:dhtech.community@gmail.com)). We would like to hear from you and your experiences! You can register for the call on Zoom [here](https://asu.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZcsfu2vqDwpGtfYv45G3pP4O0NeJmSerHgi#/registration).
