We’re almost halfway through the year, time for another DHTech newsletter! Read on to find out all about the latest happenings in your DHTech community.


### DH2024 Mini-conference “DH Inside Out”

This year in August, [DH2024](https://dh2024.adho.org/) will be held at George Mason University in Arlington, Virginia, USA. DHTech will hold a mini-conference at DH2024 themed “DH Inside Out” on Monday, August 5 from 9am to 4:30pm. The program for the mini-conference [is out now](https://dh-tech.github.io/blog/2024/06/14/dh-inside-out-dh2024-program/)! Go check it out and join us for a packed day full of interesting technical-focused talks.

Don’t forget to register for our mini-conference when registering for DH2024! It is listed as a [pre-conference workshop](https://dh2024.adho.org/program/workshops/).

And there will be Swag! We will bring new stickers and other swag. So make sure to stop by our mini-conference and say hi. And if you have contributed to one of our projects or working groups, there might even be a small token of gratitude waiting for you!


### Call for BoF Panelists at US-RSE’24

Check out [the call](https://forms.gle/AmNHEpnSxf7qcqa98) for panelists for a [US-RSE’24](https://us-rse.org/usrse24/) Birds of a Feather conversation “RSEs in domain-specific ecosystems” about how the experiences of research software engineers differ by domain. The conversation will engage questions such as: 

How do differences in research domains impact the training needs of RSEs? 
What types of institutional support and infrastructure are needed to support RSEs and scholars in the humanities and social sciences vs. other domains? 
How might DH RSE experience benefit and inform RSE roles in other domains? 

For more details and to indicate your interest to be a panelist, please complete [this nomination form](https://forms.gle/AmNHEpnSxf7qcqa98) by July 15, 2024.


### Code Review Call

The next quarterly deadline to submit code for review is coming up on June 30. Check out [the website](https://dhcodereview.github.io/submit-code.html) for instructions on how to submit your code. If you have any questions about what can and cannot be reviewed, please get in touch with the working group in Slack in the #code-review-wg channel or send an email to dhtech.community@gmail.com. If you are interested in becoming a reviewer, please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/PepxF6U64AT2Y5TZA).

Not ready to submit your code for review? Please let us know why, by filling out [this form](https://forms.gle/AWW61fPNPteF3zpG8). It would greatly help us to understand how we can serve the needs of the community better and how to improve our process.


### Journal of Open Humanities Data - Special Issue

Check out [this call for papers](https://openhumanitiesdata.metajnl.com/announcements#call-for-papers-amplifying-glam-collections-scalable-and-inclusive-data-practices) for a special issue of the Journal of Open Humanities Data: "Amplifying #GLAM #Collections: Scalable and Inclusive Data Practices." 

The editorial team is looking for folks in Galleries, Libraries, Archives, Museums, Records and allied disciplines to submit either short data papers or full research papers — this special issue is being edited by GLAM workers for GLAM workers.


### Tell us About Your Career Path

Those of you who attended DH2023 may remember we organized a panel on DH RSE careers. Since there is still no established career path for this work, it’s important to share the varied paths people have taken to the DH technical work we do now, in whatever capacity. We want to hear more of those stories and share them on the DHTech website. Contact us in Slack or via dhtech.community@gmail.com if you’re willing to share what you do and how you got there.


### DHTech Job Board

We decided that it is time for a DHTech job board! If you have a job posting you think might be of interest to the DHTech community, consider submitting it using [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/12yCTlRrUPdJBg-v1OFJgy2p25ZDV2pIMvjgl9fQax6U/edit). We will add a new section to our website that lists current jobs as soon as we have the first job posting submitted. If you would be willing to help out with reviewing and adding job postings to the website, please get in touch on Slack or by emailing the steering committee at [dhtech.community@gmail.com](mailto:dhtech.community@gmail.com).

### DHTech Email Address

Email [dhtech.community@gmail.com](mailto:dhtech.community@gmail.com) if you want to reach the DHTech Steering Committee.
