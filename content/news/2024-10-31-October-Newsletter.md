You might have noticed that you didn‚Äôt find a lovely newsletter in your inbox in August of this year. We will try to make it up to you by putting some extra effort into this one. We planned on starting out with a programmer joke for Halloween, however, turns out they are all really bad. Here is one that came the closest to being funny:

> Why did the scarecrow become a successful software developer?  
> Because he was outstanding in his field!  
> üôà

But let‚Äôs move on. We have a newsletter packed with (hopefully not too spooky) updates about your DHTech Community. Enjoy!


### DHTech at DH2024 - Take the Survey!

At this year's DH conference at George Mason University in Arlington, Virginia, USA, we held a mini-conference titled ‚ÄúDH Inside Out‚Äù about the technical aspects of DH projects. We had an amazing lineup of presenters (thank you all!) with many interesting talks and discussions. In fact, it went so well that we plan to do it again next year! Stay tuned for the call for participation and call for reviewers. 

If you have 5 minutes, **please fill out our [post-mini-conference survey](https://forms.gle/XRGsAoUmYcMnWBkE7)**. Even if you didn‚Äôt attend, we are interested to know why you didn‚Äôt attend and what would be valuable to you in the future. 

In addition to our mini-conference, we also had a lunch meetup with pizza (thank you ADHO for the funds!) and the [DHippo Challenge](https://dh-tech.github.io/blog/2024/08/07/dhippo-challenge/)! The best part is that we still have DHippos. Do you want one? Simply write a short blog post for our DHTech website and we‚Äôll try to get one to you. Contact us in Slack or via email (dhtech.community@gmail.com).

To conclude, we really enjoyed seeing new and familiar faces, many interesting discussions, and are looking forward to DH2025!


### US-RSE‚Äô24

The [second annual US Research Software Engineering Conference](https://us-rse.org/usrse24) (US-RSE‚Äô24) took place in Albuquerque, New Mexico from October 15 to 17. While vastly outnumbered, some DH research software engineers did attend and even organized a Birds of a Feather session on ‚ÄúRSEs in domain-specific ecosystems.‚Äù  We talked about how working as a research software engineer differs depending on the domain, especially when comparing digital humanities to a STEM field (science, technology, engineering, and math). It was an engaging and interesting 90 minutes discussion. US-RSE‚Äô25 will be held in Philadelphia next year, so mark your calendars!


### DHTech RSE Survey

In 2019, DHTech ran a survey to better understand the DHTech and DH RSE communities. Five years later, we are preparing another survey to see how the field has changed. Please join the `#dhtech-survey-2024` Slack channel if you want to shape the survey questions or help with reviewing and analyzing the results. Otherwise, keep an eye out for the survey, which we will launch later in November!


### DHReSCU is looking for Projects and Consultants

Thanks to a Chair‚Äôs grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, Arizona State University in collaboration with colleagues from Princeton University and Harvard University is exploring the development of a Digital Humanities Research Software Consulting Unit (DHReSCU). This virtual unit will provide digital humanities researchers with the opportunity to consult experienced DH RSEs during the project planning and design phase to create a software development plan. To that end, DHReSCU is looking for [projects](https://dhrescunit.github.io/posts/project/) and [consultants](https://dhrescunit.github.io/posts/consultant/). Consultants as well as projects will be compensated for their time with a small stipend. 

More information can be found on the [DHReSCU website](https://dhrescunit.github.io/). 


### Submit Code For Review

The next **submission deadline for code review requests is coming up on December 31**. A description of the process and what it takes to have your code reviewed can be found on the [code review website](https://dhcodereview.github.io/). If you have any questions about what can and cannot be reviewed, please get in touch with the working group in Slack in the `#code-review-wg` channel or send an email to dhtech.community@gmail.com. If you are interested in becoming a reviewer, please fill out [the reviewer application form](https://forms.gle/PepxF6U64AT2Y5TZA).


### Become a Code Review Facilitator

Do you want to get involved with DHTech‚Äôs community code review process, but are not yet ready to become a reviewer? Don‚Äôt despair, we are looking for people interested in facilitating code reviews! No technical knowledge is required; all you need are some organizational skills. Facilitating a review involves scheduling kick-off and recap meetings and sending out a few emails. We have templates and checklists to help you along the way. It‚Äôs low effort but a really important job! You‚Äôll be recognized as a facilitator on our website afterwards and will have everyone‚Äôs deep gratitude. You can also sign up using our [facilitator application form](https://forms.gle/GPzv3wzuB5WXq24V9).


### DHTech Steering Committee Nominations

DHTech has been an ADHO Special Interest Group since 2021. For the upcoming two-year term (2025-2026), three seats on the Steering Committee need to be filled. Any member of DHTech is eligible to nominate themselves for one of the spots. To give people an idea of what it involves to be on the Steering Committee, we compiled [a blog post](https://dh-tech.github.io/2024-sc-nominations/) that summarizes the key responsibilities and tasks of the Steering Committee. We hope that this will encourage some people to nominate themselves as candidates.


### Tell us About Your Career Path

Those of you who attended DH2023 may remember we organized a panel on DH RSE careers. Since there is still no established career path for this work, it‚Äôs important to share the varied paths people have taken to the DH technical work we do now, in whatever capacity. We want to hear more of those stories and share them on the DHTech website. Contact us in Slack or via dhtech.community@gmail.com if you‚Äôre willing to share what you do and how you got there.
