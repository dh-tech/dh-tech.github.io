Do you:

- write code or do coding-related work for digital humanities projects?
- manage software engineering projects in the digital humanities?
- develop computational methods for digital humanities research?

If so and if you are over 18, please consider [completing the Digital Humanities Research Software Engineering survey](https://forms.gle/WhK4wyh62ruiGqXy5)! It should only take about 20 to 30 minutes of your time.
