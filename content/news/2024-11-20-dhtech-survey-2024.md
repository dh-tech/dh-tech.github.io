## DHTech Survey 2024

**DHTech is running a survey to better understand the experiences and needs of anyone doing technical work in the digital humanities!**

<img src="/images/posts/dhtech-survey-2024.jpg" style="width: 400px; float: left; margin-right: 20px;">

Do you do write code or do coding-related work for digital humanities projects?  
Do you manage software engineering projects in the digital humanities?   
Do you develop computational methods for digital humanities research? 

If so and if you are over 18, please consider [completing the Digital Humanities Research Software Engineering survey](https://forms.gle/WhK4wyh62ruiGqXy5)! It should only take about 20 to 30 minutes of your time.
