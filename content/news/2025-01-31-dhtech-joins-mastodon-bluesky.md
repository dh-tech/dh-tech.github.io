**DHTech is now on [Mastodon (@dhtech)](https://fedihum.org/@dhtech) and [Bluesky (@dhtech-community.bsky.social)](https://bsky.app/profile/dhtech-community.bsky.social)!** 

We're excited to join the Mastodon and Bluesky communities and contribute to these emerging social networks that we have seen an increasing number of our colleagues and friends migrate to. We intend to continue to use and cross-post content to [Twitter/X](https://x.com/dhtech_group) for now, but we'll also begin posting to Mastodon and Bluesky. Follow us on Mastodon as [@dhtech](https://fedihum.org/@dhtech) and on Bluesky as [@dhtech-community.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/dhtech-community.bsky.social).
