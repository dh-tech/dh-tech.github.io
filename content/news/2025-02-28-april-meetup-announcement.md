The next DHTech meetup will be held on April 24, 2025 at 9am ET/3pm CET. We will discuss what we can do to keep the data of our projects around and usable even long after the software used to present the data has found its natural end. How can we make sure data is understandable and usable long-term? What happens to the logic encoded in our code that is necessary to interpret the data? Where can we store data and in what format? What’s the cost to benefit ratio for creating backups that might not be used for a long time? Does this sound interesting? Come join us and [register for our Zoom meeting!](https://asu.zoom.us/meeting/register/EHJ-McYzRDCVd9kZJQr-_w)
