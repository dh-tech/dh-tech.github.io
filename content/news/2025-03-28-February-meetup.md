Our next DHTech meetup will be on February 20, 2025 at 9am ET/3pm CET. We will discuss a potential submission to RSECon25, which will be hosted at the University of Warwick in Coventry, UK from 9-11 September 2025. At US-RSEâ€™24, we organized a Birds of a Feather session to talk about how different domains pose different challenges to RSEs and require different skill sets. The idea has been floated to propose a similar session for RSECon25. Does that sound interesting?
