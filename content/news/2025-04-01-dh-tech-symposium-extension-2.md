### Digital Humanities Tech Symposium at DH2025

_Final Submission Deadline Extension and Conference Proceedings_

We have exciting news to share! In collaboration with the new ACH open access conference proceedings series [Anthology of Computers and the Humanities](https://anthology.ach.org/), there is now the option to **submit a short proceedings article** about your [Digital Humanities Tech Symposium presentation](/2025/02/19/digital-humanities-tech-symposium/) after the conference. 

Here are the quick facts:

- Proceedings articles should be 4 to 6 pages in length.
- Articles need to be submitted by August 3, 2025 (we highly recommend having a draft ready in time for the conference).
- Articles will be reviewed with potential requests for revisions.
- You will likely be asked to be a reviewer for another submission.
- Reviewed articles will be published on the proceedings website with a DOI for each article.

To give everyone interested in this opportunity a chance to submit, we have extended the submission deadline for the Digital Humanities Tech Symposium to **April 27, 2025**.
