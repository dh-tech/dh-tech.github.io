Subject: DHTech April, well May‚Ä¶, Newsletter

## News from the DHTech Community 


Dear DHTech member, 

We completely missed sending out our April newsletter! Where did April go? To make up for it, we put some extra work into this one. Starting with the joke of the month!

Son: Dad, how did you come up with my name?
Dad: Well, son, I worked countless hours to write an AI that would tell me the absolute best name for you.
Son: Wow, cool, thank you, dad!
Dad: You‚Äôre welcome, Syntax Error On Line 125!

So stupid, so good üòÑ


### USRSE‚Äô25 in Philadelphia

USRSE‚Äô25, the research software engineering conference in the US, is in Philadelphia this year! **Submission deadline is May 16** (except posters, which are due July 20). This year's theme is [Code, Practices, and People](https://us-rse.org/usrse25/participate/#call-for-submissions).

üêç **Code**: share your software with the community

üîÅ **Practices**: Discuss how RSEs code and how they can code better

ü¶Ñ **People**: Support the development of the RSE community

Let‚Äôs show some Digital Humanities RSE presence!


### Steering Committee Changes

It is with a heavy heart that we let you know that Cole Crawford is stepping down from the DHTech Steering Committee effective immediately due to recent professional career decisions. We will greatly miss him and his expertise and experiences that have helped DHTech grow so much over the past couple of years. We wish him all the best for his future endeavors!

If you are interested in getting involved in DHTech‚Äôs leadership activities, please reach out to the Steering Committee by email or on Slack.


### DHTech RSE Survey - We still want to hear from you! Last Call!

In 2019, DHTech ran a survey to better understand the [DHTech and DH RSE communities](https://dh-tech.github.io/survey-results-2020/?query=survey). Five years later, DHTech is re-running the survey to better understand the experiences and needs of anyone doing technical work in the digital humanities! Do you write code or do coding-related work for digital humanities projects? Do you manage software engineering projects in the digital humanities? Do you develop computational methods for digital humanities research? If so and if you are over 18, **please consider** [completing the Digital Humanities Research Software Engineering survey](https://forms.gle/WhK4wyh62ruiGqXy5)! It should only take about 10 to 15 minutes of your time. 

The survey results will be presented as a poster at DH2025. We will **close the survey on May 23**. So go do it, right now please! üòÉ


### DHTech at DH2025

DHTech is organizing a mini-conference at [DH2025](https://dh2025.adho.org/), **the Digital Humanities Tech Symposium!** The symposium will be held on **Monday, July 1:30 to 6pm**. The program will be posted on [our website](https://dh-tech.github.io/) soon, so keep an eye out for it and join us in Lisbon!

Want to get involved in the symposium? We're looking for **session moderators** to introduce speakers and help keep sessions on time. Email the Steering Committee or get in touch on Slack if you‚Äôre interested!

We will also organize another in-person get-together sometime during the main conference. Details to follow. Make sure to keep an eye on Slack and your email inbox!


### Upcoming Deadline

**Submit Code For Review!** The next submission deadline for code review requests is coming up on **June 30**. A description of the process and what it takes to have your code reviewed can be found on the [code review website](https://dhcodereview.github.io/).


### Get Involved!

We always welcome contributions and new ideas! Please reach out if you have something you‚Äôd like to share with the community and feel free to post in Slack and join our meetups. Below are some concrete opportunities to get involved.

- **Tell us About Your Career Path:** We believe that it is important to share the varied paths people have taken to the DH technical work we do now, in whatever capacity. We want to hear your story and share them on the DHTech website. Contact us in Slack or via dhtech.community@gmail.com if you‚Äôre willing to share what you do and how you got there.
- **Become a Code Review Facilitator:** Do you want to get involved with DHTech‚Äôs community code review process, but are not yet ready to become a reviewer? Become a code review facilitator! It‚Äôs low effort but a really important job! You‚Äôll be recognized as a facilitator on our website afterwards and will have everyone‚Äôs deep gratitude. You can sign up using our [facilitator application form](https://forms.gle/GPzv3wzuB5WXq24V9).
