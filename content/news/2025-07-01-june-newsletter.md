It’s DHTech newsletter time! There is not too much to report this month as we are busy preparing for DH2025! 


### DH2025 in Lisbon

DHTech will be represented at DH2025 with a mini-conference and a poster! On **Monday, July 14, 1:30pm - 6:30pm**, the mini-conference **Digital Humanities Tech Symposium** ([check out the agenda](https://dh-tech.github.io/2025/06/04/digital-humanities-tech-symposium-agenda/)) will be held with presentations focusing on the technical aspects of DH projects. And at the **poster session on Wednesday**, we will present a **poster about the survey** we recently ran. Come find us and get DHTech stickers and pens!

As usual, we will also organize an in-person meetup. We will meet for lunch on Thursday (self-paid). Meeting location tbd.  


### DHTech Bibliography

We decided it’s time that we added a [literature page](https://dh-tech.github.io/literature/) to our website! Our goal is to curate a list of references around the technical aspects of DH work. This includes papers about code review, software papers, papers about best practices, and anything that someone doing technical work for DH projects might find useful. Do you have something you think should be included? Or do you even want to help maintain it? Get in touch with us via email or Slack!


### Upcoming Deadline

**Submit Code For Review!** The next submission deadline for code review requests is coming up on **September 30**. A description of the process and what it takes to have your code reviewed can be found [on the code review website](https://dhcodereview.github.io/).


### Get Involved!

We always welcome contributions and new ideas! Please reach out if you have something you’d like to share with the community and feel free to post in Slack and join our meetups. Below are some concrete opportunities to get involved.

- **Tell us About Your Career Path:** We believe that it is important to share the varied paths people have taken to the DH technical work we do now, in whatever capacity. We want to hear your story and share them on the DHTech website. Contact us in Slack or via [dhtech.community@gmail.com](dhtech.community@gmail.com) if you’re willing to share what you do and how you got there.
- **Become a Code Review Facilitator:** Do you want to get involved with DHTech’s community code review process, but are not yet ready to become a reviewer? Become a code review facilitator! It’s low effort but a really important job! You’ll be recognized as a facilitator on our website afterwards and will have everyone’s deep gratitude. You can sign up using our [facilitator application form](https://forms.gle/GPzv3wzuB5WXq24V9).
