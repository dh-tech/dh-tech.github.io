We gave up trying to get this newsletter out by the end of each even month. You‚Äôll simply have to live with the fact that it will most likely come to your inbox at the beginning of the following month. But we are sure that this is something you will be able to live with üòÑ

Before we dive into the latest and greatest, we have a request! **Would you please fill out this [short poll](https://forms.gle/oMoP5sgeBTmB71Ya6) about our activities?** We want to make sure that we serve and support you in the best way possible, so we have a few questions. We‚Äôll be forever grateful for your insights!

### September Meetup on Publishing Software


Our next meetup will be on September 11, 2025 at 9am ET/3pm CET. The topic of the meetup will be **publication venues for research software**. Where do you publish your software? Do you publish it at all outside of GitHub and Zenodo? How do you let other people know your software exists? There are the big names like the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS) but are there maybe other venues not so well known? And what does it mean to publish your software? What do you write about when you publish? And even more broadly, where do you publish about your software engineering work? These and many more questions will be the focus of our next meetup. [You can register here!](https://asu.zoom.us/meeting/register/xE0TTnFfSfqp6XtxzYjwNA)

### Hugo-Bibliography

DHTech has a new project we maintain: [hugo-bibligraphy](https://github.com/dh-tech/hugo-bibliography)! Hugo-bibliography is a Hugo module designed to help you fetch and format bibliography data to include into your Hugo site. Thanks to **Tatsat Jha**, this idea we had came to life and now we need you to help maintain and develop it! If you maintain a Hugo site and always wanted to include a bibliography, now is the time to do it. Hugo-bibliography lets you pull data from a Zotero group to add it to your site. Please check it out and let us know about any bugs, improvements, or new features you think should be addressed. You are also more than welcome to contribute to the development by making a pull request. This project is **for the community by the community!**

### Let‚Äôs have another Hackathon

We think it is time for another hackathon! It‚Äôs almost three years since we organized the last DHTech hackathon. [undate](https://github.com/dh-tech/undate-python) is the result of that hackathon! You can read all about it in the recently published paper ‚Äú[Undate: humanistic dates for computation](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/computational-humanities-research/article/undate-humanistic-dates-for-computation/F6C820D6D40C5F8BB8CBC3570E34378C)‚Äù. Are you interested in participating or maybe even in helping to organize another hackathon? Please fill out our poll (linked above)! If you have any ideas for what we could develop, please let us know on Slack or by email (dhtech.community@gmail.com). 

### DH2025 - It was a blast!

DH2025 in Lisbon was once again a highlight for DHTech! We organized the Digital Humanities Tech Symposium that featured [twelve presentations](https://dh-tech.github.io/2025/06/04/digital-humanities-tech-symposium-agenda/) on various topics and presented results of our recent [DHTech survey as a poster](https://zenodo.org/records/15863899). Some of the symposium presentations will be featured in the new ACH open access conference proceedings series [Anthology of Computers and the Humanities](https://anthology.ach.org/)! Stay tuned!

Furthermore, we had a successful working group lunch (the food in Lisbon is amazing!), stickers, pens, and DHippos found new homes, and people connected IRL for a change. To give the contributions of our DHTech members more visibility, we‚Äôd like to add any talk you might have given at DH2025 to our website. **Let us know if you presented outside of our Digital Humanities Tech Symposium** by emailing us the details (dhtech.community@gmail.com) or let us know on Slack! 

### Upcoming Deadline

**Submit Code For Review!** The next submission deadline for code review requests is coming up on **October 31** üéÉ A description of the process and what it takes to have your code reviewed can be found [on the code review website](https://dhcodereview.github.io/).

### Get Involved!

- **Tell us About Your Career Path**: We believe that it is important to share the varied paths people have taken to the DH technical work we do now, in whatever capacity. We want to hear your story and share them on the DHTech website. Contact us in Slack or via dhtech.community@gmail.com if you‚Äôre willing to share what you do and how you got there.

- **Become a Code Review Facilitator**: Do you want to get involved with DHTech‚Äôs community code review process, but are not yet ready to become a reviewer? Become a code review facilitator! It‚Äôs low effort but a really important job! You‚Äôll be recognized as a facilitator on our website afterwards and will have everyone‚Äôs deep gratitude. You can sign up using our [facilitator application form](https://forms.gle/GPzv3wzuB5WXq24V9).
