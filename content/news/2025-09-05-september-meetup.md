Our next meetup will be on September 11, 2025 at 9am ET/3pm CET. The topic of the meetup will be **publication venues for research software**. Where do you publish your software? Do you publish it at all outside of GitHub and Zenodo? How do you let other people know your software exists? There are the big names like the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS) but are there maybe other venues not so well known? And what does it mean to publish your software? What do you write about when you publish? And even more broadly, where do you publish about your software engineering work? These and many more questions will be the focus of our next meetup.
