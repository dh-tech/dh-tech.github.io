DHTech has been an ADHO Special Interest Group since 2021. The group is led by a Steering Committee—an international group of seven dedicated volunteers. Each member serves a two-year term, with no limit on reappointment. For the upcoming 2026–2027 term, **five seats on the Steering Committee need to be filled**. Any member of DHTech is eligible to nominate themselves for one of these seats.

To help potential candidates understand what serving on the Steering Committee involves, we’ve written [a blog post](https://dh-tech.github.io/2025-sc-nominations/) outlining the key responsibilities and typical activities of the role. If you have time, energy, and enthusiasm for strengthening the DHTech community, we encourage you to nominate yourself and help us steer the DHTech ship forward!
