These proceedings are the first-ever official publication from a DHTech event. Ever since its founding after a workshop at DH2017 in Montreal, DHTech has been active in organizing workshops, mini-conferences and meet-ups to foster community and share knowledge. We have organized pre-conference workshops every year for the annual ADHO conference and always make an effort to document and share the outcome of our events. But it wasn’t until now that we had an official venue to share the work of our community.  We are grateful for the leadership of the Association for Computers and the Humanities (ACH) and editors of the new Anthology of Computers and the Humanities journal for their “inclusive and generous sense” of Digital Humanities work and offering opening this space for us to document and share more widely the work of the technical community represented by DHTech. 

The papers included in these proceedings are based on presentations included in the Digital Humanities Tech Symposium. The symposium inverted the typical format of presentations at the DH conference by focusing on the technical aspects of digital humanities projects, while still situating them within their specific research and disciplinary contexts. Presentations ranged from implementation details of research projects, to tool presentations and live demonstrations touching on infrastructure, authentication, and publication platforms. The proceedings papers underwent a separate review process, which not only strengthened the quality of the submissions but also raised important questions about how best to write about and review technical work, since DH projects cover such a wide range of humanities disciplines, technologies and methods. We look forward to continuing the discussion and refining these questions together as a community of technically oriented individuals.
