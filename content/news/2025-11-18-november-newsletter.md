We hope you had a great start into the month of November! Since we now officially switched from end-of-the month newsletters to beginning-of-next month newsletter, here comes the last DHTech newsletter of this year. The next one will be waiting in your inbox for you in early 2026. So enjoy these latest DHTech news one last time this year!

### Digital Humanities Tech Symposium 2025 Proceedings


We are extremely excited to announce that the proceedings of our symposium at DH2025,  [“Digital Humanities Tech Symposium 2025”](https://anthology.ach.org/volumes/vol0002/), are now published in the new ACH journal *Anthology of Computers and the Humanities*. The proceedings include seven articles and an introduction spanning from tool presentations, over architecture descriptions, to technical community initiatives. Our heartfelt thanks go to all the authors, reviewers, symposium attendees, and anyone else who was involved in making this happen! We especially want to thank Taylor Arnold, Editor-in-Chief of the Anthology, for his support in this endeavor and giving us this opportunity.

### Nominate yourself for the DHTech Steering Committee

It’s that time of the year again! Nominations for the DHTech Steering Committee are open, and we need to fill at least one spot. If you want to get more involved in this community and help shape its direction, this is a great opportunity. Wondering what it takes? [Read our blog post for more information](https://dh-tech.github.io/2025-sc-nominations/) or just go and fill out the nomination form [here](https://forms.gle/oRWAcHyQU5jFyim49).

### Technical track at DH2026

We are very pleased to let you know that for the first time, the DH conference allows submissions for a **technical track**! Specifically, the CfP reads:


*“Authors may designate their submission as part of the Technical Track. Submissions in this track, in line with the mission of the DHTech SIG, emphasize the development, sustainability, and reuse of software and infrastructures for the digital humanities. These proposals will be reviewed by members of the DHTech SIG.”*


This is very exciting news for our community! We hope it will create new opportunities to connect, collaborate, and share our work and expertise. To help the program committee match technical submissions with the right reviewers, please remember to check the box indicating that you’re available to provide technical reviews.


Submission deadline for DH2026 is **December 8, 2025**, 11:59 PM KST. You can find the CfP [on the DH2026 website](https://dh2026.adho.org/cfp/).

### DHTech Posters at DH2025 and USRSE’25


DHTech presented posters at two conferences this year: [DH2025](https://dh2025.adho.org/) and [USRSE’25](https://us-rse.org/usrse25/). Our poster [“Surveying the Digital Humanities Research Software Engineering Landscape”](https://zenodo.org/records/15863899) presented the results of the DHTech survey we ran earlier this year. Fun fact: the “typical” DH developer works in a small team of no more than three people, is (at least in part) self-taught, and programs in Python. Who would have thought? 😉 Our second poster, [“Community Code Review in the Digital Humanities,”](https://zenodo.org/records/17315401) presented the efforts of the DHTech Code Review Working Group. It described the community code review process overseen by the group and provided an overview of its impact, current challenges, and future work. Both posters are available on Zenodo.
