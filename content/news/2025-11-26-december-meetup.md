summary: Before 2025 comes to a close, DHTech is planning one more meetup to discuss how to build a Python Package Community for the Humanities. Are you a developer of a Python package for DH research? Or maybe you are not the developer but you are using someone else’s Python code? Do you wish there was such a community to support you in your efforts? Do you wish there was a way of sharing your work with others so it could be reused? If so, then join us on December 4, 2025 at 10am ET/4pm CEST!

Imagine this: You are working on a Python package for a research project. Your code could easily be used by others if you had more use cases, but you don’t know how to connect with others, or maybe you are even wondering if your code is “good enough.” Now, imagine, there is this online community. You sign up for their Slack and they provide you with some guidelines and tips on how to make your project more stable and maintainable. Once you have cleaned up your code, you submit it to this community, it gets reviewed, and then added to the community website as a supported project. More people notice your work now, and maybe there are even people who are interested in helping you maintain it\! How awesome would that be\!

Before 2025 comes to a close, DHTech is planning one more meetup to discuss exactly this vision\! Are you a developer of a Python package for DH research? Or maybe you are not the developer but you are using someone else’s Python code? Do you wish there was such a community to support you in your efforts? Do you wish there was a way of sharing your work with others so it could be reused? If so, then join us on **December 4, 2025 at 10am ET/4pm CEST**\! 

In our December meetup, we plan to talk about strategies to build a community similar to [pyOpenSci](https://www.pyopensci.org/) or [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/), but for the humanities. The goal of the meetup is to have a better understanding of what kind of support projects would benefit from, what kind of projects would be good candidates for such a community, and what project selection criteria and guidelines could look like. What a proper way of ending 2025 with some dear colleagues from DHTech\!
