summary: With AI coding agents and chatting computers the landscape of software development as a profession in DH is shifting. How does this shift reflect in the perspective for students, how are professionals adjusting their day to day business? How do we balance the potential loss of quality in research software with the benefit of making software development more accessible?

With AI coding agents and chatting computers the landscape of software development as a profession in DH is shifting. How does this shift reflect in the perspective for students, how are professionals adjusting their day to day business? How do we balance the potential loss of quality in research software with the benefit of making software development more accessible? 

In our February meetup we invite perspectives from the academic and for-profit sector with diverse levels of seniority to reflect on new challenges and old problems for research software development in the age of AI.
