title: DHTech Working Groups
description:
---

DHTech members with a common interest can form a DHTech working group. To be considered a working group, DHTech asks that the group:
- designates two people to serve as point of contact between the working group and the steering committee.
- writes a short paragraph for this page describing the group.
- provides bi-monthly updates about what the group is doing and how people can get involved to be included in our newsletter.

The benefits of being recognized as an official working group are that the group:
- is included on the list of working groups on this page.
- can optionally have their own github repository and website under the DHTech GitHub organization (e.g. https://github.com/dh-tech/wg-education-training).
- can apply to use some of the money we get from ADHO as a SIG to further the work of the working group.
